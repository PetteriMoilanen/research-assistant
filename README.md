Research assistant - al LangGraph/Gradio demo app

## Introduction
The LangGraph part is more of less a copy of a notebook introduced in [Module 4, Lesson 4: Research](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/take/intro-to-langgraph/lessons/58239974-lesson-4-research-assistant) of [Introduction to LangGraph in LangChain Academy](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph).

The original lesson notebook (with outputs) can be accessed at GitHub: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/blob/main/module-4/research-assistant.ipynb
