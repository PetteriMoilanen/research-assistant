A LangGraph/Gradio demo app

## Introduction

**Blaa blaa about the idea concept when you have the time...**

The LangGraph part is more or less a copy of a notebook introduced in [Module 4, Lesson 4: Research](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/take/intro-to-langgraph/lessons/58239974-lesson-4-research-assistant) of the [Introduction to LangGraph in LangChain Academy](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/intro-to-langgraph) course.

The original lesson notebook (with outputs) can be accessed at GitHub: https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain-academy/blob/main/module-4/research-assistant.ipynb
